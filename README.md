 Kidney Stone Detection

Overview
This project utilizes IBM Watson Studio to develop a machine learning model for the detection of kidney stones. The model leverages the power of IBM Watson AI to analyze medical imaging data and identify the presence of kidney stones with high accuracy.

 Features
- Data Preprocessing: Efficient data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
- Model Training: Uses IBM Watson's machine learning algorithms to train the model.
- Model Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation metrics to measure model performance.
- Deployment: Easy deployment and integration into healthcare systems.


 Prerequisites
- IBM Cloud account
- IBM Watson Studio
- Python 3.7 or later

 Installation

Set Up IBM Watson Studio:
    - Create an IBM Cloud account if you donâ€™t have one [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration).
    - Create a new project in IBM Watson Studio.
    - Upload the dataset to Watson Studio.
    - Configure Watson Machine Learning service.

 Usage

1. Data Preprocessing:
    - Preprocess the medical imaging data.
    - Normalize and prepare the data for training.

2. Model Training:
    - Train the model using IBM Watson's machine learning algorithms.
